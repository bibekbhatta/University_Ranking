Provides university rankings for Climate, Social Justice and Gender and overall ranking.  
<b>This is a work in progress.</b>     
  
The rankings are based on following dimensions:  
Climate, Social Justice, and Gender.

<b>Methodology</b>  
Text from websites of all universities in USA, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are used to determine the rankings.  
Maximum 15 pages are used from the official website of each university.  The pages were checked during Easter break 2025.  
Links are used from each homepage, up to 3 level deep, to download text from each university.  

Universities with less than 4000 words in their webpages are discarded.
