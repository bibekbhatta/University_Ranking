[Access data Dashboard here!](https://uniranking.streamlit.app/)   

<b>This is a work in progress.</b>     
  
The rankings are based on the following dimensions:  
Climate, Social Justice, and Gender.

<b>Methodology</b>  
Text from websites of all universities in USA, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are used to determine the rankings.  
Maximum 15 pages are used from the official website of each university.  The pages were checked during Easter break 2025.  
Links are used from each homepage, and links in resulting pages may also be used (up to max 15 pages in total for each university) to download text.  

Universities with less than 4000 words in their webpages are discarded.

Rankings are based on the number of occurrences of various words (shown below) along each of the 3 dimensions, scaled by the total number of words in the respective university's webpage.Then the "Overall Rank" is created as the sum of the three scores.
